## Missing functionality

- Currently transparent surfaces do create shadows but not full shadows, depending on their level of transparency the level of light that they block. But colored transparent surfaces don't alter the color of the light that passes through them, it only attenuates it.

- Speculative reflection doesn't seem to work properly on transparent surfaces (imagine the shine on a bubble)
